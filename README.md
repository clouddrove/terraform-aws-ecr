We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.



## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)



## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-alb/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "alb" {
    source                     = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-alb.git"
    name                       = "alb"
    application                = "clouddrove"
    environment                = "test"
    label_order                = ["environment", "name", "application"]
    internal                   = false
    load_balancer_type         = "application"
    security_groups            = ["sg-xxxxxxx"]
    subnets                    = "subnet-xxxxxxx"
    enable_deletion_protection = false
    target_id                  = "i-xxxxxxxxxx"
    vpc_id                     = "vpc-xxxxxxxxx"
    target_group_protocol      = "HTTP"
    target_group_port          = 80
    listener_certificate_arn   = "arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:certificate/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx"
    https_enabled              = true
    http_enabled               = true
}

## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
